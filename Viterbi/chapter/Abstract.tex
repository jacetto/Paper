Robot localization during navigation is one of the fundamental problems of robot navigation. Topological localization characterizes the map nodes either in terms of global or local features extracted from sensor inputs. Following the local features approach, more precisely using the \textit{bag-of-word} scheme and its extension called \textit{Vocabulary-Tree} we focus in this paper on the geometrical check of the recognition pipeline. The use of a dynamic programing algorithm together with the way we define the problem allow for a fast assertion of basic geometrical characteristics while comparing local features of 2D range data. Moreover this geometrical test filters out some of the most critical erroneous feature matching that could occur. This last property allows then to solve an outlier free linar system for estimating the relative position of the robot.
